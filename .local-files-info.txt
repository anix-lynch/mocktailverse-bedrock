# Local Files (Not on GitHub)

These files exist locally but are hidden from GitHub:

## AI_CONTEXT.md
- Purpose: Context for future AI agents
- Contains: AWS info, deployment workflows, secrets locations
- Why local: Looks too "AI-assisted" for hiring managers

## docs/_archive/
- Purpose: Verbose documentation archive
- Contains: Interview prep, detailed walkthroughs
- Why local: Keep GitHub clean and professional

## How to Access
